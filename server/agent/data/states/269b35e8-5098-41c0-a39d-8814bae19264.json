The error message indicates that the \"large_orders_view\" does not exist, which is crucial for the analysis to identify the top 10 customers by total order amount.\n\nThe approach would be to join the two views on the customer ID, group the data by customer ID, sum the order amounts to get the total order amount for each customer, and then order the results by total order amount in descending order, limiting the results to the top 10.\n\nHowever, without the correct data, I'm unable to provide a final analysis. Please verify the existence and accessibility of the views and the correctness of the view names. Once we have the correct views or tables, we can proceed with the analysis.",
