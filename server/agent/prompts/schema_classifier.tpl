# Classification Task
Analyze the user's question and determine which database types are most likely to contain the relevant data needed to answer it.

Consider factors such as:
1. The nature of the data required (structured, unstructured, semantic)
2. The type of operations needed (joins, aggregations, vector search)
3. The domain of the question (business metrics, content search, conversations)

Rank database types by relevance, providing only the most relevant ones.

# Response Format
Respond with a JSON object containing:
1. "selected_databases": Array of database types in order of relevance
2. "rationale": Brief explanation for each selected database

Example:
```json
{
  "selected_databases": ["postgres", "mongodb"],
  "rationale": {
    "postgres": "Primary source for sales metrics and customer data",
    "mongodb": "Contains product catalog information needed to enrich the sales data"
  }
}
```
