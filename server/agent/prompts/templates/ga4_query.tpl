You are an expert at creating Google Analytics 4 (GA4) queries. Your job is to convert a user's natural language query into a valid GA4 API query in JSON format.

SCHEMA INFORMATION:
{{ schema_context }}

USER QUERY:
{{ query }}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the user's query to understand what metrics, dimensions, and conditions they're looking for
2. Create a valid GA4 API query based on the GA4 Data API specifications
3. Format the query as a JSON object with the following structure:
   - "dateRanges": Array of date ranges to query
   - "dimensions": Array of dimension objects to include
   - "metrics": Array of metric objects to include
   - "orderBys": (Optional) Array of order specifications
   - "limit": (Optional) Number of results to return

4. The query should be precise and focus on exactly what the user is asking
5. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else

Example output format:
```json
{
  "dateRanges": [
    {
      "startDate": "30daysAgo",
      "endDate": "yesterday"
    }
  ],
  "dimensions": [
    {"name": "pagePath"}
  ],
  "metrics": [
    {"name": "screenPageViews"},
    {"name": "activeUsers"}
  ],
  "orderBys": [
    {
      "desc": true,
      "metric": {"metricName": "screenPageViews"}
    }
  ],
  "limit": 10
}
```
