# Diff Algorithms Demonstration
## Using `test-orchestration-agent.ts` as Example

This document demonstrates the six different diff algorithms from our research dump using real changes to the `test-orchestration-agent.ts` file.

## Base File Context
The original file is a test script for OrchestrationAgent with AWS Bedrock integration. We'll show how different algorithms handle the same modifications.

## Sample Changes Applied
1. Fix a typo: "sucessful" → "successful" 
2. Add a new test case for edge cases
3. Refactor error handling
4. Add performance metrics logging

---

## 1. Character-Level Diff

**Use Case:** Maximum precision, catches every single character change
**Granularity:** Individual characters

### Example Output:
```diff
Line 127: const testCases = [
    {
      name: 'Grammar Fix (Should be TRIVIAL)',
      request: 'fix my grammar',
-     context: {
+     blockContext: {
        blockId: 'test-1',
        content: 'This sentence have bad grammar and spelling mistakes.',
        type: 'text'
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'Data Analysis (Should be OVERPOWERED)',
      request: 'analyze the sales data and create a chart',
-     context: {
+     blockContext: {
        blockId: 'test-2', 
        content: 'Sales data: Q1: $100k, Q2: $150k, Q3: $200k',
        type: 'data'
      }
    }
```

**Character-by-character breakdown:**
```
Position 1847: 'c' → 'b' (context → blockContext)
Position 1848: 'o' → 'l' 
Position 1849: 'n' → 'o'
Position 1850: 't' → 'c'
Position 1851: 'e' → 'k'
Position 1852: 'x' → 'C'
Position 1853: 't' → 'o'
Position 1854: '' → 'n'
Position 1855: '' → 't'
Position 1856: '' → 'e'
Position 1857: '' → 'x'
Position 1858: '' → 't'
```

**Pros:** Catches every single change, perfect for precise tracking
**Cons:** Very noisy, breaks natural word boundaries, poor readability

---

## 2. Word-Level Diff (Ceneca's Choice)

**Use Case:** Natural editing boundaries, good for prose and code
**Granularity:** Words and whitespace tokens

### Example Output:
```diff
Line 127: const testCases = [
    {
      name: 'Grammar Fix (Should be TRIVIAL)',
      request: 'fix my grammar',
-     context:
+     blockContext:
      {
        blockId: 'test-1',
        content: 'This sentence have bad grammar and spelling mistakes.',
        type: 'text'
      }
    },
+   {
+     name: 'Edge Case Handling (Should be OVERPOWERED)',
+     request: 'handle undefined input gracefully',
+     blockContext: {
+       blockId: 'test-6',
+       content: undefined,
+       type: 'unknown'
+     }
+   },
```

**Word tokenization:**
- `context` → `blockContext` (single word replacement)
- Entire new test case added as cohesive blocks
- Maintains code structure and readability

**Pros:** Perfect balance of precision and readability, respects language syntax
**Cons:** May miss sub-word changes, requires smart tokenization

## 3. Line-Level Diff (Traditional Git)

**Use Case:** Source code comparison, familiar to developers
**Granularity:** Complete lines

### Example Output:
```diff

   ];
```

**Pros:** Clean visual separation, great for code, familiar interface
**Cons:** Misses intra-line changes, shows entire line even for small edits

---

## 4. Semantic Diff

**Use Case:** Code refactoring, structural changes, IDE integration
**Granularity:** Language constructs (functions, objects, etc.)

### Example Output:
```diff
testCases Array:
  ~ Modified object property: 'context' → 'blockContext' (5 occurrences)
  + Added new test case object: 'Edge Case Handling'
    - name: 'Edge Case Handling (Should be OVERPOWERED)'
    - request: 'handle undefined input gracefully'
    - blockContext: { blockId: 'test-6', content: undefined, type: 'unknown' }

Function testOrchestrationAgent():
  ~ Modified variable assignment: testCases array structure
  + Added error handling block in classification loop
  + Added performance metrics calculation
    - New variable: startTime = Date.now()
    - New variable: testTime = Date.now() - startTime
    - Modified: totalTime += testTime calculation
```

**Abstract Syntax Tree Changes:**
```
ObjectExpression (testCases[0]):
  - Property: context → blockContext
  - Value: unchanged
  
ArrayExpression (testCases):
  + Element: ObjectExpression (new test case)
    - Property: name → "Edge Case Handling..."
    - Property: request → "handle undefined..."
    - Property: blockContext → ObjectExpression
```

**Pros:** Understands code structure, great for refactoring, IDE-friendly
**Cons:** Language-specific, complex implementation, may miss formatting

---

## 5. Three-Way Diff (Merge Scenarios)

**Use Case:** Collaborative editing, merge conflicts, version control
**Granularity:** Compares three versions (base, yours, theirs)

### Example Scenario:
**Base Version:** Original `test-orchestration-agent.ts`
**Your Changes:** Added edge case handling
**Their Changes:** Added performance monitoring

### Three-Way Merge Output:
```diff
<<<<<<< Your Changes
    {
      name: 'Edge Case Handling (Should be OVERPOWERED)',
      request: 'handle undefined input gracefully',
      blockContext: {
        blockId: 'test-6',
        content: undefined,
        type: 'unknown'
      }
    },
=======
    {
      name: 'Performance Test (Should be TRIVIAL)',
      request: 'measure response time',
      context: {
        blockId: 'test-6',
        content: 'Performance test data',
        type: 'benchmark'
      }
    },
>>>>>>> Their Changes
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
```javascript
// Auto-merged: Both added different test cases
const testCases = [
  // ... existing cases ...
  {
    name: 'Edge Case Handling (Should be OVERPOWERED)',
    request: 'handle undefined input gracefully',
    blockContext: {  // Your change: context → blockContext
      blockId: 'test-6',
      content: undefined,
      type: 'unknown'
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Performance Test (Should be TRIVIAL)',
    request: 'measure response time',
    blockContext: {  // Merged: Applied your naming change here too
      blockId: 'test-7',
      content: 'Performance test data',
      type: 'benchmark'
    }
  }
];
```

**Pros:** Handles complex merge scenarios, resolves conflicts intelligently
**Cons:** More complex algorithm, requires common ancestor, harder to visualize

---

## 6. Patience Diff

**Use Case:** Better handling of moved code blocks, structural changes
**Granularity:** Identifies unique lines as "anchors" for better alignment

### Example with Code Movement:
**Original Order:**
```javascript
// Test cases covering different scenarios
const testCases = [
  // ... test cases ...
];

console.log(`\n📋 Running ${testCases.length} test cases...\n`);

let successfulLLMClassifications = 0;
let totalClassifications = 0;
let totalTime = 0;

for (const testCase of testCases) {
  // ... test execution ...
}
```

**After Moving Performance Metrics Setup:**
```javascript
// Test cases covering different scenarios
const testCases = [
  // ... test cases ...
];

// Initialize performance tracking
let successfulLLMClassifications = 0;
let totalClassifications = 0;
let totalTime = 0;
let detailedMetrics = [];

console.log(`\n📋 Running ${testCases.length} test cases...\n`);

for (const testCase of testCases) {
  // ... test execution ...
}
```

### Patience Diff Output:
```diff
  const testCases = [
    // ... test cases ...
  ];

+ // Initialize performance tracking
+ let successfulLLMClassifications = 0;
+ let totalClassifications = 0;
+ let totalTime = 0;
+ let detailedMetrics = [];
+
  console.log(`\n📋 Running ${testCases.length} test cases...\n`);

- let successfulLLMClassifications = 0;
- let totalClassifications = 0;
- let totalTime = 0;

  for (const testCase of testCases) {
```

**Standard Diff Would Show:**
```diff
  const testCases = [
    // ... test cases ...
  ];

- console.log(`\n📋 Running ${testCases.length} test cases...\n`);
-
- let successfulLLMClassifications = 0;
- let totalClassifications = 0;
- let totalTime = 0;
+ // Initialize performance tracking
+ let successfulLLMClassifications = 0;
+ let totalClassifications = 0;
+ let totalTime = 0;
+ let detailedMetrics = [];
+
+ console.log(`\n📋 Running ${testCases.length} test cases...\n`);
```

**Patience Algorithm Advantage:**
- Identifies `console.log` line as unique anchor
- Recognizes variable declarations were moved, not deleted/added
- Shows cleaner, more intuitive diff

**Pros:** Better handling of moved code, cleaner diffs for refactoring
**Cons:** More computationally expensive, may be overkill for simple changes
