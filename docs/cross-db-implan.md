# Implementation Strategy: Cross-Database Orchestration with Schema Registry

I recommend implementing this project in vertical slices that deliver end-to-end value incrementally, starting with core functionality and progressively adding sophistication.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Schema Registry Core**
   - Implement SQLite database schema as described in `schema-registry.md`
   - Build basic Python API for registry operations (CRUD)
   - Create simple introspection workers for PostgreSQL and MongoDB

2. **Database Classification Module**
   - Develop the classifier that determines which databases to query
   - Start with simple rule-based approach before adding LLM complexity
   - Integrate with your existing adapters

3. **Minimal Cross-Orchestrator**
   - Create the `CrossDatabaseOrchestrator` class with basic initialization
   - Implement schema searcher for multiple databases
   - Build end-to-end smoke test (question → selected DBs → schema)

**Deliverable**: CLI tool that can analyze a query, determine relevant databases, and display matching schema elements from each.

## Phase 2: Planning Agent (Weeks 3-4)

1. **Basic Planning Templates**
   - Develop the cross-database LLM prompt templates
   - Implement planning agent that generates simple query plans
   - Add schema registry validation layer

2. **Plan Representation**
   - Create structured classes for representing query plans
   - Implement DAG builder for operation dependencies
   - Add serialization/deserialization for plans

3. **Validation Chain**
   - Integrate planning agent with schema registry
   - Add schema validation for generated plans
   - Implement dry-run capability for basic validation

4. **Two-Phase Schema Awareness**
   - Implement a planning-time schema retrieval using FAISS indices
   - Ensure execution-time validation using Schema Registry
   - Build synchronization mechanism to detect schema drift between the two

**Deliverable**: System that generates and validates cross-database query plans (viewable but not yet executable).

## Phase 3: Implementation Agent (Weeks 5-6)

1. **Core Execution Engine**
   - Implement the execution engine for query plans
   - Add parallel execution capabilities with semaphore control
   - Create result handling infrastructure

2. **Result Aggregation**
   - Build the `ResultAggregator` for joining heterogeneous data
   - Implement type coercion between different databases
   - Add error handling for partial failures

3. **Enhanced CLI & API**
   - Update CLI to support cross-database operations
   - Add progress reporting for long-running operations
   - Create basic API endpoints for programmatic access

**Deliverable**: End-to-end system that can execute cross-database queries with basic result aggregation.

## Phase 4: Refinement & Enhancement (Weeks 7-8)

1. **Advanced Planning Features**
   - Enhance planning agent with stakeholder analysis
   - Add business ontology support to schema registry
   - Implement semantic layer integration

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching layer for query results
   - Implement tiered metadata search
   - Optimize parallel execution strategies

3. **User Experience**
   - Develop better error messages and explanations
   - Add visualization capabilities for complex plans
   - Implement progressive result streaming

**Deliverable**: Production-ready system with advanced features and optimized performance.

## Critical Dependencies & Risk Mitigation

1. **LLM Reliability**
   - *Risk*: Unpredictable LLM outputs could derail planning
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust schema validation and fallback strategies
   - *Action*: Create a test suite with challenging edge cases

2. **Database Diversity**
   - *Risk*: Different databases might require special handling
   - *Mitigation*: Start with two databases, then expand cautiously
   - *Action*: Document adapter patterns for extending to new databases

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - *Risk*: System could slow down with many databases or complex queries
   - *Mitigation*: Use profiling early and implement performance monitoring
   - *Action*: Set up performance benchmarks against which to measure improvements

## Project Governance

- Weekly demos showing vertical slice progress
- Continuous integration with automated tests for each component
- Documentation updated alongside code for each phase
- Regular performance benchmarking to catch regressions

This approach gives you a working system at each phase while systematically building toward the full vision. It also prioritizes the schema registry as a foundational element that supports reliability from the beginning.
