A good rule of thumb is to tackle this in vertical slices—pick the smallest end-to-end flow that exercises both your orchestration core and the two-agent split, then iteratively enhance each piece. Here’s a suggested sequence:

1. **Foundation: Metadata & Discovery**

   * **Implement your DB‐Classifier** (*from “Automatic Database Selection”*) so that any NL query first yields a prioritized list of data sources.
   * Wire it into your existing `schema_searcher.initialize(db_types=…)` call.
   * **Smoke-test** by sending simple “What tables do you have?” prompts and verifying you only fetch schemas for the flagged sources.

2. **Minimal Orchestrator Loop**

   * Build a bare‐bones `CrossDatabaseOrchestrator` that:

     1. Accepts a user question.
     2. Runs the classifier to choose DBs.
     3. Pulls back each DB’s schema (no planning, no queries yet).
     4. Returns a JSON summary of “db\_candidates” + their schemas.
   * This gives confidence that your adapters, schema endpoints, and classifier are wired correctly.

3. **Stubbed Planning Agent**

   * Hook in a very simple LLM prompt that:

     * Takes the NL query + the list of schemas.
     * Returns a toy “plan” with one or two steps (e.g. “Step 1: Select \* from Table X”).
   * Parse that plan into a structured object and return it to the caller.
   * **Goal:** Validate your plan serialization and the end-to-end LLM call, before worrying about rich decomposition logic.

4. **Stubbed Implementation Agent**

   * Build the “doer” to accept the plan’s code snippets and just execute them sequentially against the right adapters (with very coarse error-catching).
   * Have it return dummy or real data back to the user.
   * **Goal:** Confirm your code-execution plumbing is reliable.

5. **Vertical Integration & Testing**

   * Tie together: user → orchestrator → classifier → planner → plan JSON → doer → results.
   * Write a handful of smoke tests (“Show me count of rows in X”, “Give me top 3 docs matching Y”) to validate each piece.

6. **Iterate on Individual Enhancements**

   * Gradually replace your stubbed planner with the full “deep stakeholder analysis” + “hierarchical decomposition” prompt described in the markdown.
   * Swap in your semaphore-based batching and retry logic in the doer.
   * Introduce schema-drift polling, FAISS shard-routing, streaming, metrics, etc., one capability at a time.

7. **User Feedback & Human-in-the-Loop**

   * Once the basic flow works, enable plan preview for a small set of internal users or stakeholders—gather feedback on plan clarity and adjust your prompts/templates before you roll out more complexity.

By starting with a narrow slice—“classify → plan one step → run it” — you’ll validate your orchestration backbone with minimal code, then layer in the richer planning logic, reliability features, and multi-index FAISS strategies over subsequent sprints.
